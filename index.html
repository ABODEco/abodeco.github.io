                 I am an Australian born Sri Lankan so naturally I am an avid cricket fan and love a good curry. I speak Sinhalese at home and have previously studied at Monash University, I was studying a Science degree but couldn’t envision myself in the field within the next ten years, I was after a bit more diversity and change, Information Technology stood out as I found myself intrigued 
                 by my friends working on their assignments. The coding aspects and the all round skills they were doing on tasks, ranging from coding to management to implementation seemed like a field with a lot of opportunities so naturally I figured there is a higher chance that I will be able to find something that I love doing, so I enrolled in a couple IT units where I learnt the basics of Java, 
                 HTML and a few other languages and I haven’t looked back since. I saw RMIT as an opportunity to follow that dream and set myself on my way. I feel goals are not as important as the process, I mean you may get to do something you absolutely love but if it was ten years of painstaking effort, I’d rather not, I’d rather the process be as enjoyable as the end product.

I embrace and enjoy all these cultures of my life and am especially proud to be an Aussie. I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University. Everything about technology and how it is advancing fascinates me and I guess that it why I chose to 
                study IT, and so far it has kept me very interested. One interesting hobby of mine is cooking a mean steak. It’s my favourite thing to eat and I have developed a passion for improving and perfecting each steak.

                I was born in Australia (Melbourne) and have been raised around the North / North Eastern suburbs my entire life. I live in Northcote right now and completed my VCE schooling at Diamond Valley College. I know survival sign language (survival is stretching it) and currently attempting to speak Italian and Japanese due to the fact half my family can speak Italian and I plan
                on going to Japan for a while in the future (next couple years). I've worked as a virtual reality game designer for a little over one year and in that time also was studying programming and general information technology at school. Right now I am studying Appilied Science (Psychology) and Introduction to Information Technology as my elective, seeing as technology is already a 
                huge part of our world and I believe will be a core of our society, it would be wise to have some knowledge around the subject.

                <p>
                Our three personalities: <br>
                    <b> Russel </b> - Entertainer, Visual Learner, 52.65 Creativity Score <br>
                    <b> Joe </b> - Protagonist, Visual Learner, 56.41 Creativity Score <br>
                    <b>Julian </b> - Campaigner, Visual Learner, Honest Work Ethic <br>
                </p>
                <p> Indication for our group? <br>
                    This indicates a good dynamic between the three of us. As an entertainer, Russel is predicted to get easily bored
                    an unmotivated however this an be nullified by my campaigner personality that predicts me to be able to come up 
                    with stimulating ideas. However the two of us are easily mislead and can find it difficult to complete a task and
                    that's where Joe comes in with his protagonist type personality which are natural leaders.
                    This means our three strengths all counter our three weeknesses as campaigner mentally stimulates entertainer, protagonist gets campaigner to focus and the
                    entertainer can manage the selfless personality of the protagonist.

                Our next project is the production and implementation of a 'Smart Hub'. <br>
                Starting with energy saving powerpoints.

                <h4>Idea</h4>
                <p>
                A control panel that is remotely connected to all powerpoint switches in a household. Each
                having the ability to remotely turn each switch on or off at the press of a button. Can be 
                connected via classic signal such as a remote control or connected to the house wifi.

                <h4>Development</h4>
                <p>
                The development of these smart powerpoints and smart hub can consist of tools already
                developed today. Therefore meaning development of this project can be done with todays
                technology. Said technology consists of a infared radiation signaling (the form of communication
                a remote has with a tv) and then standard 2.4 gigahertz frequencies for a wifi centred method.
            </div>

            <div class="col-block item-service" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h4>Production</h4>
                <p>
                Production of this project would come in the form of mass production seeing as countless
                smart powerpoints would have to be made and many smart hubs. Production can be autonomous
                to ensure supply meets demand.

            <div class="col-block item-service" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h4>Distribution</h4>
                <p>
                The powerpoints and smart hub will be installed in every new house after released to the public.
                Each new house will require the need to have smart powerpoints over old original ones. At the same
                time the option to have your current powerpoints replaced with smart powerpoints will be open to the
                public.
                </p>

            <div class="col-block item-service" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h4>Installation</h4>
                <p>
                Installation will be carried out by an electrician when a new household is being built. When a customer
                buys the product for their already existing house, the customer can install everything themselves or an
                option for an electrician to come out to install the smart huband smart powerpoints will also be available.
                </p>
           
            </div>
<div class="col-block item-service" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h4>Trouble Shooting</h4>
                <p>
                Our main task, or most concerning task, in the project is the implementation of this technology into everyone's
                lifestyle. As evident in the smart showerhead product during the drought a fair amount of years ago, the product
                was an obvious improvement over a normal showerhead however due to the failure of distribution and implementation,
                majority of Australian citizens went without buying any. This is a problem this project faces that we intend to correct,
                not following the same path as the showerhead as we are placing emphasis on how we can get this product in the households
                of every Australian.
